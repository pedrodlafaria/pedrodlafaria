My name is Pedro Faria.
My background is in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I have several different interests, many of which focus on the use of software to tackle problems of some social and worldly relevance.
If you are interested in taking a look at my projects, go to my website, at https://pedrodlafaria.github.io/ . It is currently under construction, however.
