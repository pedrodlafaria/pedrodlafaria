My name is Pedro Faria and I am a software developer.
My background is in Mathematics and Computer Science. My current focus is on web development, mostly front-end with React.

I have several different interests, many of which focus on the use of software to tackle problems of some social and worldly relevance.
If you are interested in taking a look at my projects, go to my website, at https://pedrodlafaria.github.io/ . It is currently under construction, however. But should be done soon.
