## Introduction

My name is Pedro Faria and my background is mainly in Mathematics and Computer Science.

<br>

## Main professional activities and interests

Software Development, AI, Computer-Assisted Reasoning, and Computer Science in general.

My past activities in AI have been carried out in a professional context, while heading the research department at AKKA Benelux (Brussels, Belgium). For that reason, you will not find anything here. If you are interested in looking at those projects (videos and descriptions) go to my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrodlafaria/) and take a look at my Akka Research Benelux sections.

A common theme in my background is my interest in computer-assisted analysis and reasoning (using AI and other techniques). I am currently very interested in the development of AI Assistants using LLMs combined with other techniques.

## Personal projects on GitHub

I use GitHub to host a few other personal projects and experiments. The most interesting of these is arguably a program analysis tool called JSMapper, written in Javascript. It can analyze Javascript code and draw a few diagrams that depict the identified code structures and some of their relationships: modules, classes, function call graph (currently under development). It is the only truly active project.
